If you are on an Android device or an iPhone, this is how to turn off autoplay on YouTube from the YouTube mobile app:

1. Open the YouTube app.

2. Click on any video to play it (you can then pause the video).

3. Tap the icon at the top and middle of the screen, this is the Autoplay icon. If Autoplay is on, this will show a triangular play button.

4. When you turn off Autoplay, it will show “Autoplay is off” and the icon will change to a pause symbol.
